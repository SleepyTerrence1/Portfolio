# Portfolio
Welcome to my digital playground — also known as my GitHub Portfolio! This site is a curated showcase of my coding adventures, creative experiments, and the occasional "oops, that broke everything" moment (don't worry, I fixed it… eventually).
Here you'll find:
- 🛠️ Projects that reflect my skills in Frontend coding like HTML and CSS, along with backends like JS, Java, python, etc!
- 📚 Code samples that are clean, readable, and occasionally sprinkled with comments that may or may not include dad jokes.
- 🚀 Ideas in motion — prototypes, passion projects, and proof-of-concepts that might one day change the world… or at least make someone smile.
Whether you're a recruiter, collaborator, or just someone who clicked the wrong link and ended up here — I'm glad you stopped by. Feel free to explore, fork, star, or just admire from a safe distance. And if you like what you see, let's connect!
