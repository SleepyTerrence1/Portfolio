About This Website
Welcome to my digital playground — also known as my GitHub Portfolio! This site is a curated showcase of my coding adventures, creative experiments, and the occasional "oops, that broke everything" moment (don't worry, I fixed it… eventually).
Here you'll find:
- 🛠️ Projects that reflect my skills in HTML, CSS, Python, Java, SQL, and more! — from sleek front-end interfaces to robust back-end logic.
- 📚 Code samples that are occasionally clean and readable. Im sorry
- 🚀 Ideas in motion — prototypes, passion projects, and proof-of-concepts that might one day change the world… or at least make someone smile.
Whether you're a recruiter, collaborator, or just someone who clicked the wrong link and ended up here — I'm glad you stopped by. Feel free to explore, fork, star, or just admire from a safe distance. And if you like what you see, let's connect!
